# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction & Exchange App
#### IEEE diode project


An accurate crypto price prediction model plays a key role in business planning, but at the same time, it is a challenging task. By analyzing the historical prices using a knowledge-based system and machine learning, one can analyze the crypto market cycle.

In this project, we will be developing a cryptocurrency exchange app and predicting the prices in realtime using Natural Language processing.
